WHAT I LEARN WEEK 4

* # This Might Be A DOMb Idea

Your task (whether you choose to accept it or not?) is to manipulate the DOM

# Ugly Query

This project will be JUST like [Ugly Webby](https://github.com/ci-wdi-900/ugly-webby), but this time you'll be editing the JavaScript file ONLY. (Except if, for convenience, you want to add IDs or classes to elements in `index.html`.) Run queries with `querySelector` and `createElement`s until you have the ugliest page possible!

# Side Effect Query Functions

These functions won't `return` anything, just make changes to the current DOM. They also won't take in any complex objects, just strings! Remember that variables with strings in them can be used _exactly the same_ as the strings themselves.

# Num Loops
* Write a function that prints the numbers.
* Write a function that prints the strings.
